# Server-Side Authentication Plan

## 1. Account Deletion API Endpoint

**Requirement**: As per PRD US-007, deleting an account will trigger a secure backend process to remove the user from `auth.users` and a cascading delete of all their associated data (flashcards) from the database.

**Implementation Note**: A dedicated secure backend API endpoint needs to be created to handle this. This endpoint will receive a request from the client (after user confirmation and password re-entry), verify the user's identity, and then initiate the deletion process within Supabase, ensuring all associated flashcards are also removed.
