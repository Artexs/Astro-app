   1. The flashcard grid will be a responsive component with 1-3 columns based on page width and will feature infinite scroll.
   2. The UI will use optimistic updates for the "Review" screen, providing immediate visual feedback while API calls run in the background.
   3. The "My Cards" page will refetch data from the server after new cards are added to ensure data consistency.
   4. Error notifications will be displayed in a component in the bottom-left corner of the screen.
   5. The application layout will be responsive and adapt to the page width.
   6. The "Study" module will pre-fetch the next card to improve user experience.
   7. Session expiry will be handled by redirecting the user to the login page.
   8. The application will support full keyboard navigation for all flashcard actions (accept, reject, reveal, next, etc.).
   9. The project will formally adopt a component library like Shadcn/ui for consistency and speed.
   10. The loading indicator for flashcard generation will be a simulated, dynamic text progress bar.
   11. The main navigation bar will be a single, persistent component that conditionally renders links based on the user's authentication state.
  </decisions>
  <matched_recommendations>
   1. Flashcard Grid Component: Create a generic FlashcardGrid React component that is responsive (1-3 columns) and accepts props to render context-specific actions (Accept/Reject vs. Delete) and handle infinite scroll.
   2. Keyboard Navigation: Implement keyboard shortcuts for all major flashcard actions: Arrow keys for navigation, 'A' for Accept, 'X' for Reject, 'N' for Next, and 'Delete' to trigger deletion.
   3. Error Notification Behavior: Use auto-dismissing toast notifications (5 seconds) for non-critical errors and persistent notifications for critical errors that require user action (e.g., a "Retry" button).
   4. Empty State Handling: On the "My Cards" page, if a user has no cards, display an "empty state" component with a message and a call-to-action button to the "Create" page instead of automatically redirecting.
   5. High-Friction Confirmation Modals: For critical actions like account deletion, use a modal that requires the user to type a confirmation word (e.g., "DELETE") and re-enter their password.
   6. Simulated Progress Indicator: For the synchronous generation process, use a loading screen that cycles through a predefined list of status messages (e.g., "Analyzing text...") to simulate progress.
   7. Optimistic UI Updates: On the "Review" screen, when a user acts on a card, update the UI immediately (e.g., fade out) while the asynchronous API call proceeds in the background. Provide a retry mechanism on failure.
   8. State Synchronization: To ensure data consistency, the "My Cards" page should invalidate its cache and refetch data from the GET /api/flashcards endpoint after new cards have been added.

  UI Architecture Planning Summary

  This summary outlines the key decisions and architecture for the AI Flashcard Generator's user interface, based on the product requirements, technical stack, and planning conversation.

  1. Main UI Architecture Requirements
  The frontend will be built using Astro for static pages and server-side rendering, with React for interactive "islands of interactivity." Styling will be handled by Tailwind CSS, and the project will formally adopt a component 
  library like Shadcn/ui to ensure consistency and accelerate development of elements like modals, buttons, and notifications. The UI will be organized into distinct pages with clear routing, managed by Astro.

  2. Key Views, Screens, and User Flows
   * Pages: The application will have separate pages for core functions: /login, /signup, /forgot-password, /account, /create, /review, /my-cards, and /study.
   * Authentication Flow: Users will navigate through standard, separate pages for sign-up, login, and password reset. The main navigation bar will be a single, persistent component that conditionally renders links based on the 
     user's auth state.
   * Flashcard Generation & Review Flow: The user will input text on the /create page, guided by a real-time word counter. After submitting, a simulated progress indicator will be shown. The user is then taken to the /review page, 
     where a responsive grid displays the generated cards. Users can accept or reject cards using keyboard shortcuts or mouse clicks, triggering an optimistic UI update (fade-out with icon) while the API call runs in the 
     background.
   * Card Management & Study Flow: The /my-cards page will display the user's collection in a responsive, infinite-scrolling grid. If a user has no cards, an "empty state" component will guide them to the create page. The /study 
     page will feature a minimalist interface with a single card that uses a 3D flip animation and pre-fetches the next card to ensure a smooth experience.

  3. API Integration and State Management
   * API Endpoints: The UI will interact with the defined REST API for all core operations: POST /api/flashcards/generate, POST /api/flashcards, GET /api/flashcards (with pagination for infinite scroll), DELETE 
     /api/flashcards/{id}, and GET /api/flashcards/study/random.
   * State Management: The application will favor server-state synchronization over complex client-side state management. For instance, after new cards are accepted, the /my-cards view will refetch its data to ensure it is 
     up-to-date. Client-side state will be managed within React components for UI-specific states like animations or form inputs. Optimistic UI updates will be used on the "Review" screen to provide immediate feedback.

  4. Responsiveness, Accessibility, and Security
   * Responsiveness: All views, particularly the card grids, will be fully responsive, adjusting from a 3-column layout on wide screens to a single column on mobile devices.
   * Accessibility: The application will be fully navigable via keyboard, with intuitive shortcuts (A for Accept, X for Reject, N for Next, etc.). All interactive elements will have clear focus states, and ARIA attributes will be 
     used to announce dynamic content changes to screen readers.
   * Security: User authentication will be handled by Supabase. The UI will use the Supabase client library to manage JWTs and session state. An onAuthStateChange listener will automatically redirect users to the login page upon 
     session expiration. Critical actions, like account deletion, will be protected by high-friction confirmation modals requiring password re-entry.
